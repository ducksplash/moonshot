WINSTON

...is stuck on the moon!

One day, Winston found himself stuck on the moon.

Nobody knows how or why.

Can you help him get home?




This is my entry for the GitHub Gameoff 2020.

The theme is "moonshot" and this represents my own personal moonshot.

Join me as I attempt to go from zero Unity experience to a playable game in 28 days.

Will I make it or will I spend most of the time trying to animate a cat's legs?

I guess we'll find out!

UPDATE:

FINISHED!!

Huge big thanks to the following people; they don't know it but they helped me out a bundle with some props and music:
